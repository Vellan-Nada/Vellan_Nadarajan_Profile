            <h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
            <h3>Graduate Design Engineer at Dyson Malaysia (September 2023 - Present)</h3>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Contributed to the design of three next-generation vacuum cleaner projects, collaborating with crossfunctional teams, including engineering, finance, procurement, manufacturing, suppliers and electronics, to
                    ensure design compliance with requirements.
                    </li>
                <br/>
                <li>Owned two sub-assemblies (Bin & Filter assembly, UI Assembly), designing 18 key components including
                    plastic parts, seals, and common parts, across three vacuum cleaner projects using NX Siemens. Came up
                    with different concepts for parts and chose the best design using Concept Selection Matrix. Created 3D CAD
                    drawings and defined part requirements to facilitate the material selection process.
                    </li>
                <br/>
                <li>Managed the bill of materials (BOM) for a vacuum cleanerâ€™s sub-assembly and released it for production
                    process. Generated assembly drawing using NX Siemens for that sub-assembly which explains the precise
                    sequence for assembling the components at production line.
                    </li>
                <br/>
                <li>Conducted tolerance stack analysis for parts to ensure it can align and fit properly with neighboring parts as
                    per the design intent.
                    </li>
                <br/>
                <li>Created mock-up parts to prove the functionality of my design ideas. Created prototypes of my designed
                    parts using 3D printing technology and laser cutting to test their mechanical robustness and validate their
                    structural performance.
                    </li>
                <br/>
                <li>Conducted leak tests for certain parts to ensure it meets the product and air watt requirement and updated
                    the design based on the results to improve the sealing performance.
                    </li>
                <br/>
                <li>Conducted investigative tests to prove the functionality of the electro-static discharge (ESD) scheme of our
                    vacuum cleaner to prevent static discharge to the user.
                    </li>
                <br/>
                <li>Designed and assembled jigs that was used for static load tests for certain parts, as part of the validation
                    process. Designed and released a drawing for a jig that will be used to assemble a part in the assembly line.
                </li>
            </ul></p>
            <h3>Mechanical Engineer Intern at Camfil Malaysia (August 2021 to September 2021 for 8 weeks)</h3>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Conducted operation and process qualification for a new pleating machine and adhesive material.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>A customer complaint about leakage in their filters was investigated as part of a troubleshooting
                    process. Failure analysis was conducted and a report detailing the process was generated.
                    </li>
                <br/>
                <li>Involved in Industrial 4.0 initiative at Camfil. Analyzed the possibility of implementing assisted
                    automation in a gel application system through a closed loop integrated system.
                    </li>
